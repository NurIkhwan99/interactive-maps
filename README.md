# Interactive Map Application

This project is an interactive map application with a graphical user interface that allows users to view various places, add labels, display information about places, and customize the appearance of the map. The map provides the ability to zoom and move to explore different locations.

## Getting Started

To run the interactive map application, follow the steps below:

1. Create a directory and place the `app.py` and `index.html` files in the same directory.

2. Inside the directory, create another folder named `templates` and put the `index.html` file inside it. This folder is required for Flask to render the HTML template.

3. Open your command prompt or terminal and install Flask and requests by typing the following commands:
`pip install flask`

`pip install requests`

5. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command in the command prompt or terminal.

6. To run the application, execute one of the following commands:
`python app.py`
or
`flask run`

7. Once the application is running, click on the provided URL in your browser to open the interactive map.
